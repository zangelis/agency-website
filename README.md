# Agency Website

I'm sharing here the code for the first draft of an agency website that I made using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/zangelis/agency-website.git
cd agency-website
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from index.html and paste it into the search bar.
